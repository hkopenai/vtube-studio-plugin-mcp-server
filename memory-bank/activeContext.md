# Active Context: VTuber Plugin

## Current Work Focus
Currently, the project is in the initialization phase of setting up the memory bank documentation structure. The focus is on establishing a solid foundation for project context and continuity across sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the core requirements and goals of the VTuber Plugin project.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, operational expectations, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Complete the setup of remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Review the existing codebase in `src/` and `test/` directories to update memory bank files with detailed technical context and system patterns.
- Identify any immediate tasks or issues in the project that require attention based on the current file structure and test files.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determining the depth of initial documentation in memory bank files to balance clarity with brevity.
- Deciding how to structure additional context files or folders within `memory-bank/` for future complex features or integrations specific to VTuber functionalities.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: Prioritize comprehensive documentation to ensure continuity after memory resets, following the memory bank structure.
- **Modular Development**: Align with the project's goal of a modular architecture by organizing documentation to reflect modularity in tools and utilities.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of a well-structured memory bank cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the ability to pick up work after a reset.
- Initial observations of the project structure suggest a focus on Live2D integration, which will require specific documentation for parameter control tools and authentication utilities.

This document integrates insights from `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`, focusing on the immediate context and ongoing work for the VTuber Plugin.
