# Active Context: VTuber Plugin

## Current Work Focus
The project has moved beyond initialization to a detailed code analysis phase. The current focus is on understanding the existing implementation for Live2D integration with VTube Studio and updating documentation to reflect these insights.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the core requirements and goals of the VTuber Plugin project.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, operational expectations, and user experience goals.
- Completed setup of all core memory bank files: `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Conducted detailed code analysis of `mcp-server.ts`, `getLive2DParameters.ts`, and `authenticate.ts`, revealing the plugin's core functionality for VTube Studio integration and Live2D parameter control.

## Next Steps
- Update `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` with detailed insights from the code analysis.
- Review test files in `test/` directory to assess the current testing coverage and identify potential gaps or issues.
- Identify and prioritize feature enhancements or bug fixes based on the analysis and test results for the VTuber Plugin.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determining the depth of initial documentation in memory bank files to balance clarity with brevity.
- Deciding how to structure additional context files or folders within `memory-bank/` for future complex features or integrations specific to VTuber functionalities.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: Prioritize comprehensive documentation to ensure continuity after memory resets, following the memory bank structure.
- **Modular Development**: Align with the project's goal of a modular architecture by organizing documentation to reflect modularity in tools and utilities.
- Tool must follow api details in https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio . A local copy can be used VTubeStudio_README.md
- Tool should provide parameter for `data` field in the Request
- The tool simply return result to the caller and assume the respond as json

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of a well-structured memory bank cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the ability to pick up work after a reset.
- Initial observations of the project structure suggest a focus on Live2D integration, which will require specific documentation for parameter control tools and authentication utilities.

This document integrates insights from `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`, focusing on the immediate context and ongoing work for the VTuber Plugin.
