# Project Brief: VTuber Plugin

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a VTuber plugin, likely integrating with live streaming or virtual avatar applications. The plugin aims to enhance the functionality of VTuber setups by providing specific tools and utilities for interaction with Live2D models and other related technologies.

## Core Requirements
- **Integration with Live2D**: The plugin must support interaction with Live2D models, including parameter manipulation for animations and expressions.
- **TypeScript Implementation**: The codebase is written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Modular Architecture**: The system should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new tools and utilities.
- **Testing Framework**: A robust testing setup to ensure reliability and functionality of the plugin components.

## Goals
- Develop a reliable and efficient plugin for VTuber applications.
- Ensure compatibility with existing VTuber software and platforms.
- Provide clear documentation and easy-to-use interfaces for end-users and developers.
- Maintain a high standard of code quality through testing and continuous integration.

## Scope
The scope of this project includes the development of core functionalities for Live2D parameter control, authentication utilities, and potential future expansions for additional VTuber-related features. The project will focus on the technical implementation within the current directory structure at 'c:/Projects/waifu/vtube-plugin'.

## Key Deliverables
- A fully functional VTuber plugin with Live2D integration.
- Comprehensive test suite covering major functionalities.
- Documentation for setup, usage, and development contributions.
