# Progress: VTuber Plugin

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Setup**: The core documentation structure has been established with the creation of `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`. This provides a solid foundation for project continuity.
- **Project Structure**: The existing codebase in `src/` and `test/` directories indicates a functional starting point with defined modules for tools, utilities, and testing.

## What's Left to Build
- **Detailed Code Analysis**: A thorough review of the existing codebase to update memory bank files with specific insights into functionality, especially for Live2D integration and authentication mechanisms.
- **Feature Development**: Implementation of additional tools or features for the VTuber Plugin, such as advanced Live2D parameter controls or integration with streaming platforms.
- **Testing Enhancements**: Expansion of the test suite to cover all critical paths and edge cases, ensuring robustness as new features are added.
- **User Documentation**: Creation of end-user guides and tutorials to support VTuber creators in using the plugin effectively.

## Current Status
- **Initialization Phase**: The project is currently focused on setting up comprehensive documentation through the memory bank structure to ensure context retention across sessions.
- **Documentation Complete**: All core memory bank files are in place, providing a clear overview of project goals, technical setup, and system design.

## Known Issues
- **Limited Code Insights**: Without a detailed review of the codebase, specific issues or bugs in the current implementation are not yet documented. This will be addressed in upcoming tasks.
- **Incomplete User Feedback Loop**: Mechanisms to gather and incorporate user feedback for plugin improvements are not yet established.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Focus on Documentation**: The decision to prioritize memory bank setup was made to address the challenge of memory resets, ensuring that all future work can build on a well-documented foundation.
- **Modular Approach Confirmation**: Early analysis of the project structure reinforced the importance of a modular design, which will guide future development and documentation efforts.

This document integrates insights from all other memory bank files, providing a snapshot of the VTuber Plugin's progress and ongoing priorities.
