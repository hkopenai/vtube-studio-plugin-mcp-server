# Project Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks the ongoing development and testing progress for the VTube Studio Plugin project. It includes updates on feature implementation, testing enhancements, and integration with the VTube Studio API.

## Recent Updates

### Development Milestones
- **Initial Setup**: Project scaffolding completed with necessary dependencies and configurations.
- **Core Functionality**: Basic connection and authentication mechanisms with VTube Studio API implemented in `src/mcp-server.ts`.
- **Parameter Retrieval**: Added functionality to fetch Live2D parameters using the API in `src/tools/getLive2DParameters.ts`.

### Testing Enhancements
- **End-to-End Testing Suite Expansion**: The test suite has been expanded with 'end_to_end_test.js' to include full end-to-end user flow simulations. This covers:
  - Connection to VTube Studio API.
  - Authentication process.
  - Parameter retrieval and updates.
  - Handling edge cases such as network interruptions.
- **Future Testing Focus**: Further enhancements could focus on additional edge cases and specific scenarios like model loading failures, hotkey execution errors, and parameter injection issues.

### API Integration Details
- **VTube Studio API Documentation**: Comprehensive details fetched from the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio). Key API functionalities relevant to testing include:
  - **Authentication**: Token request and management for plugin access.
  - **Hotkey Execution**: Triggering hotkeys for model control and testing user interactions.
  - **Parameter Management**: Creating, deleting, and injecting custom parameters for testing model responses.
  - **Model and Item Control**: Loading/unloading models and items, and controlling their properties for simulation of user scenarios.
  - **Post-Processing Effects**: Testing visual effects and their impact on model rendering.

## Next Steps
- **Enhance Edge Case Testing**: Develop test cases for less common scenarios and failure modes.
- **Performance Testing**: Implement tests to measure API response times and plugin performance under load.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Plan for incorporating user feedback into the testing cycle to address real-world usage issues.

## Conclusion
The project is progressing with a strong focus on robust testing to ensure reliability and functionality of the VTube Studio Plugin. Continuous updates to the test suite and integration with the API will be crucial for the success of this project.
