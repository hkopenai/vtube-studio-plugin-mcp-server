# Progress: VTuber Plugin

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Setup**: The core documentation structure has been established with the creation of all required files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`), providing a solid foundation for project continuity.
- **Project Structure**: The existing codebase in `src/` and `test/` directories offers a functional starting point with defined modules for tools, utilities, and testing.
- **Code Analysis Completed**: Detailed review of key files (`mcp-server.ts`, `getLive2DParameters.ts`, `authenticate.ts`) has been conducted, confirming the plugin's integration with VTube Studio for Live2D parameter control via WebSocket and MCP protocol.

## What's Left to Build
- **Feature Development**: Implementation of additional tools or features for the VTuber Plugin, such as advanced Live2D parameter controls or broader integration with streaming platforms beyond VTube Studio.
    - Requesting current expression state list https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio?tab=readme-ov-file#requesting-current-expression-state-list
    - Requesting activation or deactivation of expressions https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio?tab=readme-ov-file#requesting-activation-or-deactivation-of-expressions
- **Testing Enhancements**: Expansion of the test suite to cover all critical paths and edge cases, ensuring robustness as new features are added. This includes reviewing existing tests in `test/` for coverage gaps.
- **User Documentation**: Creation of end-user guides and tutorials to support VTuber creators in using the plugin effectively, based on the analyzed functionality.

## Current Status
- **Analysis Phase Complete**: The project has progressed from initialization to completing a detailed code analysis, with updated documentation in `activeContext.md` and `techContext.md` reflecting insights into VTube Studio integration and Live2D control.
- **Documentation Updated**: Core memory bank files now include specific technical details from the codebase, enhancing the overview of project goals, technical setup, and system design.

## Known Issues
- **Untested Functionality**: While the code structure is understood, specific issues or bugs in the current implementation remain undocumented until a full test review is conducted.
- **Incomplete User Feedback Loop**: Mechanisms to gather and incorporate user feedback for plugin improvements are not yet established, which could impact feature prioritization.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Focus on Documentation**: The decision to prioritize memory bank setup was made to address the challenge of memory resets, ensuring that all future work can build on a well-documented foundation.
- **Modular Approach Confirmation**: Early analysis of the project structure reinforced the importance of a modular design, which will guide future development and documentation efforts.

This document integrates insights from all other memory bank files, providing a snapshot of the VTuber Plugin's progress and ongoing priorities.
