# System Patterns: VTuber Plugin

## System Architecture
The VTuber Plugin is structured as a modular TypeScript application, designed to integrate seamlessly with VTuber platforms and Live2D models. The architecture follows a tool-based approach where individual functionalities are encapsulated in separate modules under the `src/tools/` directory, with core logic managed in `src/mcp-server.ts` and supporting utilities in `src/utils/`.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **TypeScript Usage**: Chosen for its strong typing and modern JavaScript features, ensuring robust code quality and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Each tool or feature (e.g., `getLive2DParameters.ts`) is developed as an independent module, allowing for easy updates and additions without affecting the core system.
- **Authentication Layer**: A dedicated utility for authentication (`authenticate.ts`) to secure interactions with external services or APIs, critical for user data protection in VTuber applications.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Singleton Pattern**: Likely used in the MCP server setup (`mcp-server.ts`) to ensure a single point of control for plugin operations.
- **Factory Pattern**: Potentially implemented in tool creation to dynamically instantiate different tools based on user needs or platform requirements.
- **Observer Pattern**: May be utilized for real-time updates to Live2D parameters, allowing the plugin to react to user inputs or streaming events.

## Component Relationships
- **MCP Server (`mcp-server.ts`)**: Acts as the central hub, coordinating between tools, utilities, and external interfaces. It likely initializes and manages tool instances.
- **Tools (`src/tools/`)**: Individual modules like `getLive2DParameters.ts` handle specific functionalities, interacting with the MCP server for data or command relay.
- **Utilities (`src/utils/`)**: Support modules such as `authenticate.ts` provide cross-cutting concerns like security, used by both the MCP server and tools as needed.
- **Tests (`test/`)**: Each component or tool has corresponding test files (e.g., `get_live2d_parameters_test.js`), ensuring functionality through automated testing.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Live2D Parameter Control**: The path from user input or automated trigger to parameter adjustment in Live2D models involves the MCP server receiving commands, delegating to the appropriate tool (`getLive2DParameters.ts`), and updating the model in real-time.
- **Authentication Flow**: Any external API calls or secure operations route through `authenticate.ts`, ensuring tokens or credentials are validated before proceeding, a critical path for user trust and data security.
- **Testing and Validation**: Before deployment or updates, the test suite runs to validate each component, with results influencing development priorities and bug fixes.
